		<p>Establish a static page for submitting Quiz 1 from Firehose Week 1.  Content should include a headline
			on the page that is a non-black color.  This quiz leads me to find that a database is expected when creating 
			an application in RoR.  My initial thought was to create this without using the --database= property, but soon discovered the creation process was looking for the sql database.  Apparently you can modify the environment.rb file to comment the config.framework value, will have to experiment later.   </p>

			<h1><%= quiz.lastname %>, <%= quiz.firstname %></h1>
